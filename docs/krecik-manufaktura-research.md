# Badanie techniczne – Krecik Manufaktura

(Understood. I’ll develop a full-stack technical implementation plan for Krecik Manufaktura, covering frontend structure, backend architecture, admin functionality, authentication, payments, delivery, AI integration, deployment, security, and extensibility—all aligned with your family-scale manufacturing model and future growth.

I’ll return shortly with a detailed blueprint for review.


# Technical Implementation Blueprint for Krecik Manufaktura E-Commerce

&#x20;*High-level architecture of the Krecik Manufaktura platform, featuring a decoupled Next.js frontend, a Node/Express API backend, a PostgreSQL database, and integrated services (admin panel, AI agents, payment gateway, etc.). This headless setup enables independent scaling and flexible development of each component.*

Krecik Manufaktura’s online platform will be built with a **headless architecture**, separating the customer-facing frontend from the backend e-commerce logic. This design choice maximizes flexibility for the small family team, allowing the storytelling-rich frontend to evolve independently of backend operations. All communication between layers occurs via secure APIs, ensuring that new interfaces (like mobile apps or partner portals) can plug into the same backend in the future. Below, we outline a comprehensive full-stack plan, broken into key sections addressing the frontend, backend, admin tools, user roles, payments, delivery, AI integration, deployment, security, and extensibility. The goal is a modern, scalable system that honors the family’s artisanal legacy while equipping them with enterprise-grade capabilities.

## 1. Frontend (React + Next.js)

**Framework & Structure:** The frontend will be a **React** application using **Next.js** for its hybrid rendering capabilities. Next.js enables pages to be pre-rendered on the server for faster loads and better SEO, which is crucial for an artisan brand’s discoverability. We will use Next.js 13 (or latest) with the App Router for organized file-based routing. The site map will likely include: Home page, Product listing (shop) pages, Product detail pages, an About/Story page, possibly a Blog/News page, a Contact page, and dedicated pages for Wholesale information and account management. Each page will be a React component, and common elements (header, footer, navigation) will be factored into a layout system for consistency.

**Navigation & Layout:** The UI will present an inviting, story-driven design that reflects the Krecik brand’s warmth. A top navigation bar will provide links to Shop (with dropdown categories if needed), About Us (the family story), possibly “Our Workshop” or Gallery, and a Contact link. If a **wholesale client** logs in, the navigation can adapt to show a “Wholesale Portal” section (or the site could automatically direct them to a specialized wholesale interface). We might implement a toggle or subdomain for wholesale, but initially it can be a conditional within the same Next.js app – e.g., wholesale users see additional menu items like “Bulk Order” or “Partner Pricing”. The layout will remain responsive: a mobile menu (hamburger style) and a desktop menu, ensuring older family friends on tablets or modern shoppers on smartphones all get an optimal experience.

**Page Components:** We will break down the UI into reusable components using a component library or design system for maintainability. For example: **ProductCard** (displays a product thumbnail, name, price), **ProductGallery** (image carousel on a product page), **StorySection** (for about page story text with photos), **CartDropdown** (mini cart in header), **CheckoutForm**, etc. This modular approach means new pages (like a future Lookbook or Workshop Tour page) can be assembled from existing components. We’ll also incorporate brand-consistent UI elements – possibly a custom icon or mascot (a “Krecik” mole character if rights permit, or a unique family logo) and a color palette inspired by workshop materials (earthy tones, warm wood colors). All fonts, colors, and spacing will follow a style guide to reinforce brand identity across the site.

**Mobile Responsiveness:** The site will be designed mobile-first. Key interactions (like adding to cart, viewing product details, reading the family story) will be tested on small screens and touch interfaces. We will use flexible grids (CSS Grid/Flexbox) and Next.js’s responsive image component for fluid images. For example, the product grid might collapse to a single column on mobile, and text might use larger, legible fonts for older users. Buttons and links will have adequate size for touch. By ensuring responsiveness, we accommodate both tech-savvy young customers and older generations who may use simpler devices.

**SEO & Performance:** Next.js server-side rendering (SSR) will ensure that page HTML is crawlable and loads quickly for the first visit. Static generation (SSG) or **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** will be used for pages that don’t change often (e.g., the About Us page, or product pages which only update when inventory or price changes). This yields near-instant page delivery and boosts SEO by providing search engines with ready-to-index content. We’ll implement dynamic `<head>` metadata for each page (using `next/head` or the new Metadata API) – unique titles and meta descriptions per product and page, incorporating relevant keywords (e.g., “handmade wooden toy – Krecik Manufaktura”) for search relevance. We will also add **structured data** (JSON-LD schema.org tags for products) so that search results can display rich snippets like product ratings, price, and availability. Performance optimizations will include Next’s automatic code-splitting (loading only the JS needed for each page), **image optimization** (serving appropriately sized and compressed images via Next Image component), and caching strategies. Critical pages can be statically preloaded, and a CDN layer or edge caching will be used to serve global visitors quickly. By prioritizing core web vitals (fast TTFB, optimized images, minimal render-blocking resources), the site will feel snappy and rank better in search engine results.

**Wholesale UX Considerations:** For wholesale users (B2B clients like retail shops stocking Krecik’s products), the frontend will offer a slightly different flow. Upon logging in as a wholesale partner (after approval), they might see wholesale-only product listings with bulk pricing (e.g. price per case or pallet) and possibly the ability to input quantities in bulk. The navigation could include a “Quick Order” form where they can enter SKUs or select multiple products and quantities on one page (to streamline large orders). The design will still mirror the retail side in branding, but with a focus on efficiency – e.g., list view of products with checkboxes to add multiple items to cart at once, and display of wholesale terms (like MOQs – minimum order quantities, or pack sizes). We will ensure the site clearly distinguishes retail vs wholesale pricing and options, so there’s no confusion. This dual-mode front end will be implemented using the same Next.js app for simplicity (showing different components based on user role), but it will be structured cleanly to allow separating it in the future if needed.

**Accessibility & Trust:** Throughout the frontend, accessibility will be respected: proper alt text on images (especially for product images and family photos describing the scene), semantic HTML for screen readers, and high-contrast text for legibility. Trust badges and signals will be present – for example, on the checkout page we’ll show a “Secure Payment” indicator with icons of accepted payment providers (Visa, Mastercard, *Przelewy24*, etc.) to reassure users. We’ll also highlight the family business aspect (perhaps a tagline like “From our family workshop to your home”) to create a personal connection. A footer section will include links to Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and perhaps small logos of any local craft associations or awards the family has, reinforcing credibility.

## 2. Backend (Express.js + PostgreSQL)

**Architecture & Stack:** The backend will be a Node.js server using **Express.js** (or a structured framework like NestJS if we prefer built-in patterns) to handle all business logic and data processing. It will expose a set of **RESTful API endpoints** (JSON-based) that the frontend (and other clients) consume. The choice of a Node/Express backend keeps the JavaScript ecosystem end-to-end, making it easier for the small team to maintain. Data persistence is via **PostgreSQL**, a reliable SQL database that ensures consistency for orders, inventory, and financial records. We will design a relational schema to cover both B2C and B2B needs:

* **Database Schema:** Key tables will include **Products**, **ProductVariants** (if items have variations like size or color), **Customers** (for retail users) and **Partners** (for wholesale clients, storing company info, discount terms, etc.), **Orders** (with a flag or separate subtype for wholesale orders), **OrderItems**, and perhaps **ProductionBatches**. For example, a *Product* entry for a handmade toy might have multiple *ProductVariant* rows if it comes in different colors; each variant will track its stock level. Wholesale pricing can be handled via either a discount field in *Partners* (e.g., partner X gets 30% off retail prices) or a separate price column in *ProductVariants* specifically for wholesale. The schema will also support “made-to-order” items: these could have an `isMadeToOrder` flag and no fixed stock count, instead a typical lead time field.

* **API Design:** The API will be versioned (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) and include endpoints such as:

  * `GET /products` (with query params for category, search term, etc.) and `GET /products/:id` for product detail.
  * `GET /partners/products` might return products with wholesale pricing if a partner token is provided – alternately, the same products endpoint can detect user role from auth and include appropriate pricing and availability info.
  * `POST /cart` and `POST /checkout` endpoints to handle creating an order (the checkout API will create an Order in the database).
  * `POST /orders` and `GET /orders/:id` for retrieving order details (with filters for customer’s own orders or all orders for admin). For wholesale orders, `POST /orders` will also check things like minimum order quantities or case-pack requirements.
  * `GET /orders/production?status=...` to allow the admin panel to fetch lists of orders by status (e.g., all “pending production” orders).
  * Admin-specific endpoints: `POST /products` (add new product), `PUT /products/:id` (update product info or stock), `GET /customers` and `GET /partners` (list of clients), etc., protected by admin auth.

  We will implement proper **request validation** (using middleware like celebrate or Joi to validate input payloads) to avoid bad data, and use **ORM or query builders** (like Prisma or Knex) to safely interact with PostgreSQL, ensuring no SQL injection issues. All database queries will use parameterized statements for security.

* **Retail vs Wholesale Logic:** The backend will incorporate conditional logic to handle wholesale orders differently. For instance, wholesale orders might bypass online payment (if paying on invoice) or might require checking stock in a different way (e.g., allowing ordering even if stock is low, because the family can produce on demand for a large partner order). We’ll include fields like `orderType` (retail or wholesale) and perhaps `wholesaleStatus` to track additional workflow (like “awaiting invoice payment” or “quote provided”). **Pallet/Case Quantity Logic**: If Krecik sells to wholesalers by cases or pallets, the backend can enforce multiples. For example, product metadata may include `caseSize` (say 24 units per case). When a partner places an order, `POST /checkout` will validate that quantities are in multiples of caseSize (or palletSize if by pallet). This prevents fractional orders and aligns with bulk packaging. The system might automatically round up to the next case or notify the user if an invalid quantity is requested.

* **Batch Production Tracking:** To support the artisanal production process, the backend can have a concept of **production batches**. When an order is created, if it’s for a made-to-order item or currently out-of-stock item, we mark it as requiring production. A table **ProductionBatch** might group such order items so the family knows to produce, say, 10 units of Product A for 3 different orders in one batch. Each OrderItem could have a `batchId` linking to when/which batch it’s being produced in, and statuses like “waiting for production”, “in production”, “production done”. This is an advanced feature; initially, we might keep it simpler by just using an Order status “In Production”. However, the data model will be extensible to add batch tracking if needed (to optimize their workflow as they get many orders).

* **Unified Business Logic via APIs:** The Express backend will be the single source of truth for all business rules (pricing, stock deduction, order status changes). This ensures consistency between the website and any future channels. For example, any order creation will trigger the same functions: decrement inventory (or mark reserved items), send confirmation email, etc., regardless of whether the order came from the website, an admin entering a phone order, or a wholesale partner using an API. This design follows headless principles where the backend provides a unified commerce layer for all “heads”.

* **Performance & Scalability:** We will design the API to handle spikes gracefully. Express will run in clustered mode (utilizing PM2 or Node’s cluster to use multiple CPU cores). PostgreSQL will have proper indexes on critical fields (like product SKU, order dates, customer IDs) to speed up queries. We can implement caching for certain expensive reads – e.g., caching the product list or popular products in memory (Redis or an in-process cache) to handle high traffic periods. Given that B2B orders can be larger and potentially involve more data, we ensure queries like generating an invoice or order summary are optimized (perhaps doing calculations in SQL when possible, to leverage the DB’s efficiency). The API will also include pagination for listing endpoints (like products or orders) to avoid any performance hit if those lists grow big. Should Krecik expand significantly, the stateless nature of the REST API will allow horizontal scaling behind a load balancer (multiple Node instances connecting to a managed Postgres with read replicas), ensuring the system can grow without major rewrites.

## 3. Admin Panel

**Purpose & Access:** The Admin Panel is the operational hub for the Krecik family team to run their business online. We will implement it as a secure web application accessible only to authorized staff. This could either be a separate front-end application (perhaps a secondary Next.js app or a simple Create-React-App served under a subdomain like `admin.krecik.local`) or integrated into the main Next.js app under an `/admin` route (protected by login). For simplicity and consistency, we’ll likely make it part of the Next.js project but isolated (with its own set of components and routes) – so the family can manage everything at the same domain (e.g., krecik.pl/admin) with one deployment.

**Inventory Management:** Admins will have an interface to manage **Products** and inventory. This includes forms to add new products (with fields for name, description, price, cost perhaps, SKU, category, stock quantity, photos upload, etc.), edit existing products, and manage variants. We will incorporate an **image upload** mechanism (possibly integrating with a cloud storage service or directly storing small images in the database as Base64 if low volume, but better to use cloud for scalability). There will be a listing of all products with search/filter by category or name, and indications of stock levels. Low-stock items could be highlighted (and we can build a feature to send low-stock alerts via email to the admins when inventory falls below a threshold). Because Krecik might have many one-of-a-kind or limited-run items, we might also allow marking a product as “limited” or “discontinued” easily in the admin, which would reflect on the storefront (e.g., “Only 5 left!” badges or “Sold Out” status).

**Order Processing:** Orders will be central to the admin panel. We will split the view into **Retail Orders** and **Wholesale Orders** (or provide filters to differentiate). A dashboard screen will show new incoming orders in real-time (possibly using web socket or polling). Each order entry will show key info: order number, customer name, date, total amount, payment status, and current fulfillment status. Clicking an order brings up the **Order Details**, which includes: list of items (with any personalization notes if offered), shipping address, chosen shipping method, payment method and status (paid, pending, etc.), and an **Order Timeline** (history of status changes, e.g., “Order placed”, “Payment received”, “In production”, “Shipped on \[date]”). Admins can update the status through this interface – e.g., mark an order as “Shipped” and input a tracking number, which would trigger a customer notification email. For wholesale orders, the detail view might also include the partner’s purchase order number (if they provided one) or any special terms (like “Payment due 30 days”). We will allow exporting order data (PDF invoice or packing slip generation from this view, see below). The system will log which admin user updated an order status or made changes (for accountability, using an event log).

**Content Management:** In addition to products, the admin panel will let the team edit **content pages** like the About Us, homepage banners, or blog posts. We can implement a simple CMS-like feature: e.g., an “Articles” or “Blog” section where they can create posts (title, content, images) that appear on a News page or homepage carousel. For static pages like “About Us”, we might store that content in the database or as markdown files that the admin can edit via a rich-text editor. The admin UI will provide a form with a text editor (maybe a lightweight WYSIWYG or Markdown editor) to update those sections. This way, the family can update their story or add a new photo without needing a developer. Similarly, homepage banners or featured products could be managed – e.g., choose three products to feature on the homepage this week, or upload a new banner image announcing a holiday sale.

**Partner/Stockist CRM:** As wholesale partners are a distinct user group, the admin panel will include a **Partners** section. Here, admins can see all registered wholesale clients with their details: company name, contact person, contact info, any notes (like “longtime partner since 2023” or “prefers rustic style items”), and their pricing tier or discount rate. We will allow the admin to approve or reject new wholesale account requests here (when a user signs up as wholesale, they might be marked “pending” until approval). There will be an option to create a new wholesale order on behalf of a partner (for example, if a partner phoned in an order, the admin can input it in the system so inventory and records stay accurate). This is part of the **offline sales input** capability: an admin user can initiate an order from the admin panel, selecting either an existing retail customer or wholesale partner (or entering a new quick customer record), add products to the order (with pricing that auto-applies retail or wholesale rules), and mark a payment method (maybe “Paid by bank transfer” or “Cash at pickup”). This will generate an order in the system just like a web order. Having offline orders recorded ensures inventory and sales analytics include everything, whether the sale happened via the website, in-person at a craft fair, or through a wholesale contract.

**Event Logging & Audit Trail:** To maintain operational clarity, the admin system will log key events and actions. For instance, if an admin edits a product price or stock, that action (who and when) should be recorded (perhaps not visible to all admin users unless we implement an audit log view, but at least in the database for accountability). Order status changes and comments can be logged in the Order’s timeline as mentioned. We can also log whenever the AI assistant hands off a query to a human (if such integration exists in admin chat). This logging aids in debugging issues (like “Why was stock count wrong? Oh, someone manually adjusted it last night.”).

**UI & Tech for Admin:** The admin panel will favor function over form but still follow a clean UI (we might use a UI library like **Material-UI** or **Ant Design** to get a responsive, accessible set of components quickly). We’ll implement search and filtering in grids (e.g., to find an order by customer name or filter products by category or stock status). The design will use tables for lists, modal dialogs or separate pages for detail views and editing forms. Role-based access (see next section) will hide or disable functions a user shouldn’t have (e.g., a logistics role user might only see the orders and not the product editing screens).

**Printing & Documents:** From the admin panel, the team will be able to generate necessary paperwork. For example, clicking “Print Packing Slip” on an order will open a printer-friendly page or PDF with the order contents, customer address, and a thank-you note. Similarly, for wholesale, an “Invoice” can be generated reflecting the order with company header and payment terms (useful if payment is offline). We can create PDF templates using a library (like PDFKit or an HTML-to-PDF service) to ensure invoices look professional. These documents help in the packing and shipping process (a packing checklist inside each box to ensure all items are included) and accounting (invoice for B2B orders).

**Analytics & Reports:** As a future enhancement, the admin panel can include basic sales reports – e.g., total sales by month, best-selling products, inventory valuation. Initially, we might integrate a simple dashboard library or allow data export (CSV of orders) so the family can do their own analysis in Excel. But planning the backend with clear data models means adding an analytics dashboard later will be straightforward.

In summary, the admin panel is all about empowering a small family team with tools typically found in bigger operations, but in a simplified, user-friendly manner. It ensures **daily tasks (like fulfilling orders, updating products, responding to inquiries) are done efficiently**, and that the digital platform truly supports their handmade business without requiring constant developer intervention.

## 4. Authentication & Role System

**User Accounts:** We will implement a robust authentication system that accommodates multiple user types. Likely, we’ll use an email/password system (with secure hashing for passwords) combined with role-based authorization. Alternatively, a third-party auth service or NextAuth could be used, but a custom JWT-based auth might give more control given the roles. Key user roles include:

* **Retail Customer:** Default role for anyone who signs up on the site (or checks out as a guest, though we can also support guest checkout without account creation if desired). Retail customers can log in to view their order history, save addresses, and get order status updates, but they have no special privileges beyond their own data.

* **Wholesale Client:** This is a user who represents a business partner (stockist). The signup flow for wholesale might be separate: e.g., a “Partner Registration” form where they provide business details (company name, VAT ID, etc.). By default, when a user registers as wholesale, we mark their account as **unapproved** pending review. In the admin panel, an admin can review the info and flip a switch to approve, which assigns them the wholesale role (and possibly links them to a Partner entry in the database). Once approved and assigned **role = wholesale**, the user can log in and access wholesale-specific pricing and features. They may also get access to a “Partner Area” page that shows resources like ordering guidelines, downloadable product catalogs, etc., in addition to placing orders.

* **Admin:** This role (granted manually in the database or via an admin user management UI) has full access to the Admin Panel. Admins can manage products, view all orders, edit content, approve wholesale accounts, etc. We might have sub-roles of admin if needed (e.g., a **Content Manager** vs **Inventory Manager**), but initially the family admins likely all have broad permissions. We will protect all admin routes on the frontend by checking this role in session, and enforce it on the backend as well for API endpoints (with middleware that checks the user token’s role).

* **Logistics/Staff:** We can introduce a limited role for, say, a staff member who only handles packing and delivery. This **Logistics** role could log into the admin panel but only see the Orders section (not products or site content). They could update order statuses (e.g., mark as shipped or delivered) and perhaps see customer addresses for delivery, but not edit products or view sales analytics. This separation ensures that if the family hires a helper for deliveries, they can give them a login without exposing all admin capabilities. Implementation-wise, this is a subset of admin with restricted UI and API permissions (we can enforce via role checks: e.g., `if user.role !== 'admin' && trying to access product update -> deny`).

**Authentication Flows:** We’ll likely use **JWT tokens** for the API authentication if the frontend is decoupled. Next.js can use cookies to store a session token after login. The flow:

* A user registers or logs in via an endpoint (`POST /auth/login` or NextAuth API route), providing credentials. On success, they receive a signed JWT (or a cookie is set).
* For subsequent API calls, the JWT (or cookie) is sent and the backend verifies it (using a secret key). The token payload includes the user ID and role.
* We will implement refresh tokens or set JWT expiry appropriately (maybe a few hours for JWT and a longer refresh token in httpOnly cookie to keep sessions alive, to balance security with user convenience).
* Passwords are stored hashed (using bcrypt or Argon2). We’ll include features like password reset (via email link) and email verification for account activation, to adhere to good security and possibly GDPR requirements for consent.

**Wholesale Access Flow:** A prospective wholesale client might fill a “Request Wholesale Account” form. This could either create an account in the system with a flag (role = pending\_wholesale) or simply send an inquiry to admins. A more automated approach: we create the user record with a pending status. The admin gets notified (perhaps via email or seeing it in Admin panel) and can approve. Once approved, the system emails the partner saying “Your wholesale account is now active” and they can log in normally but now see wholesale features. Alternatively, we might give them a generic account immediately but not special pricing until approved. The plan will be clarified with Krecik on how exclusive they want wholesale sign-up to be.

**Permissions Enforcement:** At the API layer, middleware will check the JWT’s role claims. For example, an endpoint like `GET /orders` without ID might return a list of all orders – only admins or logistics should be allowed that. If a retail customer hits that, we’ll either return only their orders or a 403 Forbidden. For `GET /orders/:id`, the backend will check if the requester is either an admin/logistics (then allow any order) or a customer, in which case ensure the order’s customerId matches their ID before returning it. Similar guard for wholesale: a wholesale partner can only see their own company’s orders. This ensures data privacy (one customer can’t access another’s data, etc.).

We will also ensure that certain actions require elevated roles – e.g., creating or updating products will require an admin token. The frontend will hide those functions from non-admin anyway, but the backend will double-protect it.

**Session Management & Security:** We’ll implement protections like **rate limiting** on login attempts (to prevent brute force, e.g., no more than 5 attempts per 5 minutes per IP). Also, use CAPTCHAs or email verification for signup if bots are a concern. All sensitive data transmissions happen over HTTPS (enforced by the Nginx proxy with SSL). For compliance, we’ll include user-facing features like the ability to delete their account (which would anonymize or remove personal data in compliance with GDPR’s right to be forgotten) – this can be done via a request form initially, and admin can carry it out.

**OAuth and Future SSO:** While not a priority, we might leave room for offering “Login with Google/Facebook” for retail users to reduce friction. NextAuth could handle this easily. But given the local, personal nature of the brand, users might be fine creating a dedicated account. For wholesale, a direct account is more appropriate (since it’s business info).

In summary, the auth system will ensure **each user type has the right level of access**: customers get a convenient account experience, partners get special access after vetting, and family/admin members have full control. Robust authentication and authorization underpin trust and security in the platform.

## 5. Payment Integration Strategy

**Payment Gateway Selection:** To support both Polish local payments and international options, we’ll integrate a combination of payment providers:

* **Stripe:** Stripe offers a broad range of payment methods and supports transactions in PLN (Polish Złoty) as well as other currencies. Crucially, Stripe can act as an aggregator to accept methods like **Przelewy24 (P24)**, which is popular in Poland for bank transfers, as well as credit/debit cards, Apple Pay/Google Pay, etc. By using Stripe’s API, we get security (PCI compliance handled by Stripe) and flexibility (we can start with just card payments and P24, and later enable BLIK or Klarna via Stripe as needed).
* **PayPal (optional):** If Krecik plans to sell internationally or cater to customers who prefer PayPal, we can include PayPal as an option. Stripe itself doesn’t process PayPal, so this would be a separate integration or using a library that supports multiple gateways. However, many Polish consumers prefer bank payments over PayPal, so this is a secondary priority.
* **Local Payment Methods:** As per market data, **BLIK** (a one-time code mobile payment) is extremely popular in Poland, and many shoppers also use **direct bank transfers** via aggregators. If we use a local PSP (payment service provider) like PayU or Przelewy24’s own gateway, we could natively offer BLIK and bank redirects. But since Stripe now supports BLIK and P24 as well, a single Stripe integration might suffice and simplify development. We will ensure the checkout UI clearly presents these options (e.g., “Pay by Card”, “Pay by BLIK code”, “Pay via Bank Transfer (Przelewy24)”), possibly using Stripe Elements to securely handle card input.
* **Multi-currency:** We will configure the gateway to charge in PLN by default. If we anticipate Euro or other currency transactions (maybe from EU customers), Stripe allows setting up multi-currency pricing. Initially, prices on the site will be listed in PLN and we can show approximate EUR if needed, but actual charge in other currency can be handled by the customer’s bank conversion or by adding multi-currency prices in the system later.

**Cash-on-Delivery (COD):** We will offer **cash on delivery** as an option at checkout, particularly for local orders or perhaps wholesale deliveries. Even in 2025, a portion of Polish e-commerce customers (especially for certain goods) prefer COD for the assurance of paying upon receipt. In the checkout workflow, selecting COD will create the order in the system with a status “Payment Pending – COD”. The order confirmation will instruct the customer to have payment ready (and maybe mention that they can also pay by card upon delivery if the courier offers that, depending on how Krecik arranges delivery). For COD orders, since no online payment is captured, the system will skip the payment gateway step but still record the choice. The admin UI can then mark those orders as paid once the cash is collected (or if a delivery fails, mark accordingly). We will clearly communicate any extra fee for COD (as carriers often charge a fee for handling contrareimbursement) if applicable, and allow the shipping cost logic to include that.

**Wholesale Payments (Invoices):** Wholesale clients often have net payment terms (e.g., pay within 30 days of invoice) or prefer bank transfers. For these B2B orders, we will support an **“Invoice” payment method**. In practice, a wholesale user checking out could either always be set to “Pay by Invoice – due in X days” or choose between “Bank Transfer” and other methods. Likely, we treat all wholesale orders as offline payment by default: the order gets created with status “Awaiting Payment – Invoice”. The system emails an invoice PDF to the client (or the admin will do so via the admin panel). The partner then pays via traditional means (wire transfer). Once payment is received (the family will check their bank), the admin can mark the order as paid. In the future, we could integrate something like Stripe’s ACH or instant bank transfers for wholesale, but initially manual invoicing is fine and common. We will ensure the database tracks payment status and due dates for wholesale orders so admins can see which invoices are outstanding.

**Integration Implementation:** Using Stripe’s API (and others as needed) will be done in the backend for security. When a retail customer places an order:

* The frontend calls our backend (e.g., `POST /checkout`) with the order details.
* The backend will compute the order total (double-checking prices and any shipping fees, to avoid manipulation), then if an online payment is required, create a **Payment Intent** via Stripe’s API for that amount.
* We’ll use Stripe’s client library to handle P24 and card flows. For card payments, we might use Stripe Elements on the frontend which yields a token that we confirm on backend. For P24 or BLIK, Stripe can redirect or provide a widget – on success, webhooks from Stripe will notify our backend.
* We will implement **webhook endpoints** (e.g., `/api/webhooks/stripe`) to receive asynchronous updates from Stripe: e.g., payment succeeded, failed, refunded, etc. On a successful payment event, we update the order status to “Paid / Processing”. If a payment fails, we mark order as canceled or payment failed and notify the user to try again.

By using well-documented APIs like Stripe, we ensure security (card data never touches our server directly) and compliance. We’ll also be able to easily extend payment options as needed (for example, enabling Apple Pay through Stripe, or adding an installment pay later service).

**Testing & Compliance:** We will thoroughly test payment flows in sandbox mode (Stripe test keys, etc.). The checkout will have proper error handling (if a card is declined, show a message and allow a retry or choose another method). For GDPR and security, we will not store any sensitive card info on our side – everything is via token or Stripe customer ID stored if we want to allow saved payment methods in future. We will also include clear info on the checkout about secure payments (like “You will be redirected to your bank’s secure site for completion” for P24, etc., since Polish users will recognize that flow).

In summary, the strategy is to **offer multiple convenient payment methods** catering to local preferences (bank transfers, BLIK, COD) and global standards (cards, PayPal if needed), all under a unified, secure integration. This reduces cart abandonment by letting customers pay the way they trust, and it gives Krecik flexibility to handle both direct consumer sales and traditional invoiced business sales.

## 6. Delivery & Transport Module

**Shipping Options:** Krecik Manufaktura will likely offer a mix of shipping methods: standard courier/postal delivery for most online orders, and possibly a **local pickup or local delivery** option for nearby customers (since family businesses sometimes hand-deliver to local area or allow pickup at the workshop). In the checkout, we will implement a shipping address form and present available shipping methods based on that address (e.g., domestic vs international). For Poland, we might integrate with carriers like DPD, InPost, or Poczta Polska for calculated rates. Initially, we can use flat rates or simple rules (e.g., a flat fee for domestic shipping, free over a certain order value, etc.) and refine as needed.

**Internal Delivery (Own Vehicle):** If the family does their own deliveries in a local region, the system will have an option “Local Delivery by Krecik Team” at checkout for eligible postcodes. This would require defining which locations qualify (maybe by city or zipcode). Customers choosing this can perhaps select a delivery date or will be contacted to schedule. The admin panel will provide a **Delivery Scheduling interface**: essentially a view of orders marked for local delivery, where an admin can assign them to a delivery run on a particular date. This could be as simple as adding a “Scheduled Delivery Date” field to those orders. We might output a list of addresses for that date that the team can map out. For more advanced routing, integration with Google Maps or a route planning app can be done manually by the team (since volume might be low, manual planning might suffice), but as an enhancement we could incorporate something like an export of addresses that can be fed into route optimization software.

**Packaging & Checklist:** The system will assist in the packing process. Each order detail view in admin will include a **packing checklist** – essentially the list of items and quantities. We will provide a “Print Packing Slip” button (as discussed earlier) that prints a sheet with the order number, customer info, the items (with small checkbox lines for each item for manual checking), and maybe a thank-you message. This slip goes into the package. Additionally, we might allow internal notes like “Gift wrap this order” or “Include thank you card” as options on orders (if those services are offered) which would also show on the packing list. The admin panel could also support bulk printing: e.g., select multiple orders and print all packing slips at once – useful if they have to fulfill 10 orders in one go.

**Label Printing:** If using external couriers, often you can print shipping labels with barcodes. We could integrate with a courier’s API (for example, an InPost API or Shippo/ShipStation aggregator) to generate labels directly. However, that might be overkill initially. Instead, the workflow could be: admin marks an order as ready, copies the address into the courier’s software manually, and prints a label. To ease this, we’ll at least provide an “Order Summary” print that has the address in a fixed position or easily copyable text. In the future, integrating a label API is possible (e.g., generating a PDF label and tracking number when marking as shipped).

**Tracking Shipments:** For shipped orders (courier), we will capture the tracking number in the system. The admin, when marking an order as “Shipped”, can enter the tracking number and carrier name. The customer account page and confirmation email will then display that and possibly a link (“Track your package”) that opens the carrier’s tracking site. We can store a mapping of carrier name to tracking URL template for convenience. If using common APIs, we could also poll or webhook updates (but simpler is just to provide the link).

For local deliveries, since the family is the “carrier”, we might not have a tracking number, but we could send a notification like “Out for delivery today – expect our driver soon”.

**Delivery Status in Admin:** We’ll have a specific view for orders by delivery status. E.g., a tab for “Pending Shipment” (paid orders that need to be shipped or delivered), “Shipped/Out for delivery” (orders en route), and “Delivered” (completed). This helps the family manage fulfillment at a glance. For local deliveries, once an admin marks delivered (or maybe the driver has a mobile view to mark delivered), the order is complete.

**Logistics User Role:** As mentioned, if a staff member or family helper is responsible for deliveries, we can give them a **logistics login** that only shows the shipping-related parts of the admin panel. For example, they could have a screen that lists today’s scheduled deliveries with addresses and a contact number for each customer (to call if needed). They might also be able to mark an order as delivered or report issues (e.g., “customer not home, will re-attempt”).

**Route Planning Aid:** If the volume of local deliveries grows, we might integrate a third-party route planning service or at least use Google Maps API to sort addresses by distance. There are software tools for this purpose, but given scale, a simpler approach might work: list deliveries grouped by city or zip code. The admin can then manually decide a route. For now, the system’s role is mainly to list and schedule; actual route optimization can be external.

**Pickups:** If local customers can choose “Pickup at Workshop”, the system will treat it like a shipping method with no cost. The admin view for pickups can be similar – orders ready for pickup. The system can automatically email the customer when their order is marked “Ready for pickup”. The customer would likely come by, give their order number or name; the admin can then mark it as handed over.

**Bulk and Pallet Shipping (Wholesale):** Wholesale orders might be large and shipped by freight or pallet. The delivery module for these might be more manual: for a wholesale order, admin can select “Arrange Freight” as a method. They might input the freight forwarder details or mark it as “customer will pick up goods”. We will include fields in the order for things like pallet count or package count. If using a 3rd party trucking, a tracking may not be available in the usual sense; instead, an admin could upload a PDF of the bill of lading or provide a reference number. This can be handled via an “Attachment” feature on orders (to attach docs like signed delivery slips, etc., which wholesale clients could access in their portal).

Overall, the Delivery & Transport module ensures that once an order is placed, the process of getting it to the customer is **organized and transparent**. It bridges the online order with the physical world: providing the family the tools to schedule and track deliveries, and providing customers updates so they know when to expect their handcrafted goods. By planning for both standard parcel shipping and the family’s personal delivery touch, we keep operations flexible and scalable as the business grows.

## 7. AI Agent Integration (via Flowise)

**Overview of AI Roles:** We will deploy two primary AI agents to enhance the business: a **Wholesale Support Bot** and a **Partner Onboarding Bot**, orchestrated through Flowise’s multi-agent system. Flowise will allow us to create these as specialized conversational agents with access to knowledge bases and tools, and even coordinate them via a supervisor agent for complex queries. The goal is to provide instant, intelligent responses that feel like interacting with a helpful family member, thereby improving customer experience and saving the family time.

**Wholesale Support Bot:** This agent will serve existing wholesale clients (stockists) by answering queries about products, orders, and policies. It will be integrated into the **wholesale partner portal** of the site as a chat widget. Key capabilities:

* **Order Status & History**: The bot can fetch a partner’s recent orders and status. Using Flowise’s tool integration, the bot can call an internal API or database query for order status when the partner asks “Where’s my last order?” or “When will order #123 be delivered?”. For security, it will verify the user’s identity (likely the chat is only available after login, so context already tied to that partner).
* **Product Availability & Pricing**: If a partner asks, “How many units of XYZ can I get?” or “What’s the price for 100 units?”, the bot can query current inventory and pricing rules. We can equip it with a **pricing tool**: e.g., an API that given a product and quantity returns the wholesale price (including any tiered discounts). The bot can then respond with something like, “For 100 units of XYZ, your wholesale price is 50 PLN each, total 5000 PLN, and we currently have 120 in stock. Let me know if you’d like to place an order.”
* **FAQ and Troubleshooting**: It will be trained on a wholesale FAQ: e.g., payment terms (“Your invoices are due 15 days after delivery”), return policy for damaged goods, how to display the products in store (maybe they provide stands), etc. By having this info either in a knowledge base (documents it can refer to) or encoded in its prompt, the bot can instantly answer these common questions even outside of business hours.
* **Reorder Suggestions**: The bot can analyze the partner’s order history (with a tool or precomputed data). If it notices, for example, that a partner orders 50 units of a toy every quarter, and it’s been almost 3 months, the bot could proactively ask, “It’s been a while since your last order of Wooden Moles – would you like to restock? I can help with that.” This is more advanced and might come later, but Flowise agents can be triggered by certain events or data patterns to upsell in a helpful way.

**Partner Onboarding Bot:** This agent focuses on **new or prospective wholesale clients**. Imagine a retailer visiting the site and considering carrying Krecik’s products – the onboarding bot pops up to assist. Capabilities:

* **Answering Business Inquiries**: It can answer questions like “Do you offer wholesale discounts?”, “What’s the minimum order for wholesale?”, “Can I get exclusive products or custom versions?” using a prepared knowledge set provided by the Krecik family. These answers need to be consistent and detailed, highlighting the value of partnering (e.g., handcrafted nature, reliable supply, marketing support, etc.).
* **Capturing Leads**: The bot will gently collect information if someone is interested. For instance, if a user asks about wholesale, the bot can offer, “Would you like to provide your store’s name and email? Our team can send you the wholesale catalog and further details.” Using Flowise’s form capability or just conversation, it can gather their contact, business type, location, etc. This info can then either be emailed to the admin or directly inserted into a “Leads” table for follow-up.
* **Account Signup Assistance**: The bot can guide them through registering for a wholesale account. For example, if the user is ready, the bot might say “Great! I can help you create a wholesale account. Let’s start with your email.” It could either redirect them to the sign-up page or even create a temporary account via an API call and then prompt them to complete details in a follow-up email. The key is to reduce friction in becoming a partner.
* **Multilingual Greetings**: If aiming to attract international partners, the bot might handle inquiries in English and Polish at minimum. Flowise can utilize language detection or multiple language prompts to respond appropriately.

**Multi-Agent Coordination:** We will likely have a **Supervisor AI agent** (in Flowise terms) that directs queries to the right specialized bot. When a user in wholesale portal initiates chat, the context (logged-in wholesale user vs anonymous) can be passed. The Supervisor can decide: if the user is logged-in wholesale, use the Wholesale Support agent; if the user is on the public site asking about partnership, engage the Onboarding agent. If a query overlaps (like a logged-in partner asks a very general question about the company), either agent could handle it, but the system will choose whichever has the relevant knowledge.

The multi-agent system ensures each agent has a focused **expertise**: the Support bot is like a sales rep + customer service rep for existing partners, and the Onboarding bot is like a marketing rep recruiting new partners. They can operate in parallel roles, and the Supervisor funnels the conversation appropriately so the user only interacts with one coherent bot persona at a time.

**Knowledge Base & Tools:** We will feed the AI agents with the data they need:

* A curated **Wholesale FAQ document** (covering pricing tiers, shipping arrangements for bulk orders, typical lead times for large orders, customization options, etc.) which the agents can reference.
* Access to **real-time data** via tools: order database (read-only access through an API endpoint, possibly using an API key the AI can use for specific queries), product database (for inventory and specs), and maybe a pricing calculator function. We can implement these as REST endpoints that the AI calls when needed. Flowise supports tools and functions, so we can register a “CheckOrderStatus” tool for example.
* The AI should also have context about the **brand story and values**, so it responds in alignment with Krecik’s tone. We might give it a primer like “You are Krecik’s assistant, a friendly family member who is polite, warm, and a bit folksy. You always emphasize quality and tradition in answers.”

**Tone and Interaction:** Both agents should maintain a **professional yet personal tone**. They might use first names if known (“Hi Joanna, welcome back!” for an existing partner), use some informal language but respectful. For example, the Support bot might say, “No problem, I’ve checked our stock – we can ship those 50 units by next Monday.” The Onboarding bot might say, “We’re excited you’re interested in joining the Krecik family! 😊 Let me walk you through our wholesale program.” We can include a bit of emoji or exclamation for enthusiasm in onboarding, whereas support might be slightly more businesslike but still friendly. The personality reflects the family business: helpful, proud of their craft, and treating partners like extended family.

**Conversion and Follow-up:** These AI agents will help convert interested visitors into actual partners by being responsive 24/7. If the bot does its job, by the time the family checks in, they might find new wholesale sign-ups waiting. Additionally, the AI can schedule follow-ups: e.g., the Onboarding bot could, with user permission, schedule a follow-up chat or email (“I’ll have our team send you more info. Can I also check back with you next week?”). While fully automated follow-up might be tricky, we can use the data collected to trigger a human follow-up. For instance, the bot could create a CRM entry marked for a phone call by an admin.

**Continuous Learning:** We will monitor the AI chats via Flowise’s logs or an admin interface. If the bot gets asked something it can’t handle, we’ll get transcripts and train it on those answers. For example, if someone asks “Can I return unsold items after 6 months?” and the bot doesn’t know, the family can decide policy and we update the bot’s knowledge. Flowise allows refining the prompt and adding Q\&A pairs. We might also integrate a **fallback to human**: if the AI is unsure or the user is dissatisfied, it can say “I’m going to refer this to a human colleague to assist you further,” and then alert the admin (perhaps via email or highlight in admin panel) to jump in. This way the AI and human team work in tandem.

By integrating these AI agents, Krecik Manufaktura leverages cutting-edge tech to augment their small team. The wholesale bot ensures partners feel supported at any hour (which is important in B2B where they might be placing orders after store hours), and the onboarding bot helps grow the business by engaging prospects instantly. Importantly, these AI agents are designed to operate **within the family’s guidelines and values**, effectively becoming a digital extension of their customer service and sales efforts.

## 8. Deployment Strategy

**Infrastructure Overview:** We will deploy the platform on reliable Virtual Private Servers (VPS) or cloud instances, separating concerns for resilience:

* A server (or container) for the **Frontend (Next.js)** application.
* A server for the **Backend (Express API)**.
* The **PostgreSQL database** on a managed service or dedicated instance.
* Optionally, a separate instance for the **Flowise AI** services if those are resource-intensive, though initially they might run on the backend server.

Using separate servers aligns with the headless architecture by decoupling layers and allows us to scale or maintain each independently.

**Domain and Reverse Proxy:** We will use a single primary domain (e.g., `krecikmanufaktura.pl`). An **Nginx** server will serve as the reverse proxy and SSL terminator. Nginx will be configured such that:

* Requests to `https://krecikmanufaktura.pl/api/**` are routed to the backend Express server (e.g., running on an internal port 3001).
* Requests to other paths (`/`, `/shop`, etc.) go to the Next.js frontend server (e.g., port 3000).
* Websocket connections (if used for admin updates or chat) are also proxied appropriately (Nginx can handle upgrading to WS protocol).
* Nginx will handle serving static assets if Next.js outputs any (though Next can also serve them). Using Nginx gives us the ability to do additional caching or compression at the proxy level if needed.

For example, Nginx config would have:

```
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://backend-server:3001/;
}
location / {
    proxy_pass http://frontend-server:3000/;
}
```

This setup means everything is under one domain for cookies and simplicity. We’ll obtain an SSL certificate (likely via Let’s Encrypt) and enforce HTTPS. HSTS can be enabled for security.

**Process Management:** On each Node server (frontend and backend), we’ll use **PM2** (a production process manager). PM2 will ensure the app restarts if it crashes, and we can set it up to run multiple instances (for load balancing on multi-core machines) easily. For instance, PM2 can run 4 instances of the Express API if the server has 4 cores, to handle more concurrent requests. Similarly for Next.js if doing SSR, although Next.js can also internally manage a pool. PM2’s monitoring and logging features will help keep an eye on performance (we can attach a monitoring tool or simply check PM2 logs).

**Continuous Deployment:** We can set up a Git repo and CI pipeline. When new code is pushed (or a certain branch is updated), the CI can run tests then deploy to the servers, restarting the processes via PM2 zero-downtime reload. This ensures the family always has the latest improvements without manual intervention.

**Database Hosting:** PostgreSQL could run on the backend server for very small scale, but to be safe and scalable, a managed DB (like AWS RDS, DigitalOcean Managed DB, or a separate VM just for Postgres) is better. We will configure daily automated backups of the database (either via the cloud provider or cron job if self-hosted). Additionally, we’ll ensure **secure access**: the DB will accept connections only from the backend server’s IP (firewall or security group rules) to mitigate exposure. Using strong passwords and the latest Postgres version with regular updates is assumed.

**Performance Optimization:** For PostgreSQL under heavier B2B loads (like bulk inserts or complex queries), we’ll tune it (e.g., adjust work\_mem, shared\_buffers according to available RAM, add indexes as data grows). If read-heavy loads increase (e.g., many product queries per second), we could introduce a read replica. However, initially, given a small business, the load will be modest. We will also leverage caching at the app layer: for example, in-memory caching of product lists or using a CDN for images to reduce database hits. Next.js pages that are static will be cached by Vercel or Nginx if we enable it.

**Scalability Planning:** The headless separation inherently allows scaling each part:

* **Frontend**: Can be scaled by deploying on a platform like Vercel or running multiple Node instances behind a load balancer (though static pages could even be served from a CDN in ISR mode). It mainly serves HTML/JS/CSS and forwards API calls.
* **Backend**: We can horizontally scale by adding more server instances of the Express API behind Nginx (or using a cloud LB). Since state (data) is in Postgres, the API servers are stateless aside from caching. We would need to ensure session tokens are either stateless JWT or shared via Redis if not, so that any API instance can handle a user seamlessly.
* **Database**: Vertical scaling (more CPU/RAM) or adding replicas/sharding in the future. We might use a connection pool like `pgBouncer` if many connections become an issue.

**PM2 & Nginx Configuration Details:** We will set PM2 to start on boot (so if server restarts, the services come up automatically). Nginx likewise on boot. Nginx config will also include optimizations like gzip compression for assets, caching rules for static files (e.g., cache images, CSS for a long time, but not HTML API responses). It can also buffer requests if needed. We’ll monitor memory/CPU: Node apps can use something like NewRelic or simply PM2’s built-in metrics to ensure they are not overrun.

**SSL and Security:** We’ll obtain an SSL certificate via Let’s Encrypt (automatic renewal). The site will be accessed only via HTTPS; Nginx will redirect any HTTP to HTTPS. We will also keep the systems updated (apply security patches to OS, etc., regularly). Using Ubuntu LTS or similar for the servers should provide a stable base.

**Backup & Recovery:** Aside from database backups, we can also backup uploaded images (if stored on disk) – but likely we’ll use cloud storage (S3 or equivalent) for user-uploaded images and static content to simplify that. Code and configuration will be in source control. We might also snapshot the servers periodically (if cloud) so we can recover quickly from a hardware failure.

In case of a surge (say a viral promotion causing a traffic spike), our setup can be scaled by temporarily increasing the VM sizes or adding instances. Nginx can handle thousands of connections on minimal resources, so the main bottleneck would be Node processes and DB. We’ll have monitoring (maybe using a service or simple scripts) to alert if CPU, memory, or response times go beyond a threshold, so we can react.

This deployment strategy ensures the site is **highly available, secure, and maintainable**. By using standard tools (Nginx, PM2, cloud VMs), we keep it within reach of a small team to manage, while leaving room to expand onto more robust cloud infrastructure as the business grows (e.g., containerizing and using Kubernetes later, or migrating to fully managed platforms). For now, simplicity and reliability are the focus.

## 9. Security, Compliance & Scalability

**GDPR & Privacy Compliance:** Operating in the EU (Poland), Krecik Manufaktura must comply with GDPR. We will implement clear **privacy policies** and obtain user consent for data usage where required. On signup or first visit, a cookie consent banner will be shown if we use tracking cookies (e.g., for Google Analytics or a Facebook pixel). Users will have the ability to request data deletion or export. Practically, we’ll provide a contact for privacy requests and have admin functions to delete/anonymize a user’s personal data on request. For example, deleting an account could remove or scramble personal identifiers in orders (while retaining order records as needed for accounting). We’ll ensure that we only collect data necessary for fulfilling orders or improving service, and we’ll secure that data (no unnecessary exposure). Customer passwords are hashed, payment info is not stored by us (only tokens from Stripe), and personal details are transmitted only over HTTPS. We’ll also implement routine data audits to ensure we’re not retaining sensitive info longer than needed.

**Secure Coding Practices:** All inputs from users will be treated as untrusted. This means using parameterized SQL queries or ORM to avoid SQL injection, encoding output to avoid XSS, and sanitizing file uploads (should we allow, e.g., customers uploading images for custom orders, we’ll check file types). The use of prepared statements in our database layer will mitigate injection risks. On the frontend, Next.js by default escapes content in SSR rendering, but we’ll be cautious with any raw HTML insertion.

**Authentication Security:** We covered many points: strong password hashing, rate-limiting login attempts, JWT secrets stored securely (not in repo, but in environment variables on the server). We’ll also consider **2FA** for admin accounts for an extra layer (perhaps using a Google Authenticator OTP or at least ensure very strong passwords). Session cookies for normal users will be HTTPOnly and Secure to prevent XSS stealing. We might also implement **Captcha** on important actions (register, password reset request) to prevent spam or abuse.

**Authorization & Data Isolation:** The role system ensures no one can accidentally or maliciously access data they shouldn’t. For example, wholesale clients hitting retail endpoints will just get their own data or be refused if not applicable, etc. We will test these scenarios thoroughly (attempting to fetch another user’s order, etc., to confirm the backend blocks it). In the database, foreign key relationships and cascades will be set up properly so that deleting a user’s account, for instance, can optionally wipe their related data.

**Logging and Monitoring:** We will maintain server logs for both the application and Nginx. Logs will include timestamps, request info, errors, etc. We’ll also log admin actions in-app as described. These logs help in forensic analysis if something goes wrong (security incident or just a bug). For monitoring performance and uptime, we may use a service (like UptimeRobot or similar) to ping the site and alert if down. We can also use PM2’s monitoring or integrate with a more advanced APM (Application Performance Monitoring) if needed to track memory leaks or slow DB queries.

**Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention:** Besides login, we’ll rate-limit any expensive or sensitive API endpoints. For example, the product search API could be abused, so maybe limit to X requests per second per IP (though likely not an issue unless someone tries to scrape). We will also protect the contact forms or chat from spam by possibly using a spam filter or requiring a login for chat (to avoid random spam messages overwhelming the AI or team). The AI system itself could be a target (someone could try to prompt it maliciously); we’ll put usage limits or moderation on the AI (Flowise can have rules to refuse certain requests, ensuring our bots don’t output inappropriate or confidential info).

**Scalability Readiness:** While current operations are small, we design with growth in mind:

* The stateless API and horizontally scalable front/back mean if the business suddenly receives a flood of traffic (say a viral social media post), we can scale out by adding instances or moving to a higher-tier hosting without app rearchitecture.
* We’ll keep an eye on database load; if read queries become heavy, implement caching (in-memory or a Redis layer). We can also consider moving certain reads to static precomputed content if needed (e.g., a daily rebuild of a product catalog page if that becomes huge).
* For file storage (images, etc.), if it grows, we’ll offload to an object storage service (S3 or equivalent) and serve via CDN, which is an easy switch given Next.js can integrate with external loaders.
* If the family opens a **physical store or POS**, our backend can accommodate it. We’d create either a small separate POS app or just use the admin “create order” function to ring up in-person sales. We could also expose some API endpoints for a POS system to push sales into our database. The key is our central DB keeps track of inventory across channels, so it’ll prevent selling an item online that was just sold in-store.

**Third-Party Compliance:** Payment and personal data storage will follow standards. Stripe and other payment providers handle the heavy compliance for payments (PCI DSS). We just have to ensure we don’t accidentally log any credit card numbers or something – which we won’t, since Stripe Elements handles it. If we ever integrate email newsletters or Google Analytics, we will update privacy notices accordingly and allow opt-out.

**Disaster Recovery:** We touched on backups. To elaborate: we will have daily backups of the database (and more frequent incremental if feasible). We’ll test restoring from backup to ensure it works. For the application servers, since everything is in code and images (which we’ll mirror to cloud storage), we can redeploy on a fresh server within hours if one goes down. Using infrastructure-as-code or at least documented setup steps will help re-establish service quickly.

**Penetration Testing:** Before launch, we can do a security review or use automated scanners (like OWASP ZAP) to catch common vulnerabilities. Given this is a custom build, we’ll ensure things like no directory listings on the server, proper permissions on files, and no default passwords anywhere.

**Compliance with Regulations:** Beyond GDPR, since it’s e-commerce, we’ll ensure compliance with EU consumer rights directives (e.g., allowing customers to return goods within 14 days, clearly presenting terms and conditions at checkout). We’ll also ensure our email sending (order confirmations, newsletters) complies with anti-spam laws (include unsubscribe for newsletters, etc.).

In essence, we are building a platform that is not just performant and feature-rich, but also **safe, trustworthy, and compliant**. This gives customers confidence (they know their data is protected) and gives the Krecik family peace of mind that the tech won’t get them into trouble or cause a PR issue. Security and compliance are woven into every layer of the stack, from HTTPS enforcement to database design, rather than being afterthoughts.

## 10. Extensibility

The proposed system is designed with **future evolution in mind**. As Krecik Manufaktura grows and their needs expand, the platform should adapt with minimal friction. Here are key areas of extensibility and how we’ve prepared for them:

**Production Calendar & Workflow:** In the current setup, we track orders and basic production status. In the future, we envision a more detailed **production calendar** integrated into the admin panel. This could be a calendar view where the family can see all upcoming tasks: e.g., “Oct 10 – Carve 20 wooden moles (for Order #120, #121)”, “Oct 11 – Varnish and finish 20 wooden moles, plus sew 5 plush dolls (Order #119)”. To enable this, our data model already can mark items needing production. Extending it would involve creating a schedule entity that links orders or items to specific dates/staff. Because we used a relational DB, it’s straightforward to join orders with a calendar table. The UI can be built using a calendar component. This helps when the order volume increases – the family can allocate tasks on a timeline, and even potentially track labor or time spent per batch. Our system’s modular design (separating order management from product data) allows adding such a module without overhauling existing code.

**Internal Material Tracking:** As a manufacturing operation, knowing raw material levels (wood planks, fabric, clay, etc.) can be crucial. We did not fully implement this initially, but we can extend the DB with a **Materials** table and a mapping from products to material usage (Bill of Materials). When an order is placed, the system could deduct materials as well as finished inventory. For example, a wooden toy might consume a certain board-feet of wood and some nails/paint. The architecture supports this addition: the backend could have services for inventory of materials and endpoints to update or query them. We might integrate low-material alerts similar to low stock alerts. Since we anticipated growth, we kept our backend logic modular – adding a `materialsService` would not conflict with existing orderService or productService. This ensures when Krecik scales from small batch to perhaps a micro-factory, the software can help manage the supply chain.

**Multi-language Interface:** Currently, the site might launch in Polish, but we foresee adding **English** (and possibly other languages) to reach international customers or tourists who find the site. Next.js offers internationalization support (i18n) built-in, which we can leverage. We structured text content (like product descriptions, page content) in a way that can be externalized to translation files or database fields. For instance, the Product table can have name and description fields per language (or a related table ProductTranslation). Our frontend components will be built with translation in mind (using libraries like react-intl or i18next) so that all strings can swap language. Adding a language switcher toggle in the UI is straightforward. The critical part is that we’ll write the code and templates from day one assuming text isn’t hardcoded. Moreover, our SEO strategy extends to multi-language – we’ll ensure things like hreflang tags are generated by Next.js for SEO when languages are added. By planning ahead for bilingual support, we avoid a big refactor later to separate strings.

**Mobile App Integration:** While the responsive web covers most, perhaps down the line the family might want a dedicated mobile app (maybe for loyal customers or an interactive catalog). Because we built a headless backend with clear APIs, a mobile app could be developed that consumes the same `/api/v1` endpoints for products, orders, etc. We would just need to ensure CORS and auth token management are configured for app usage. Also, if using something like React Native or Flutter, the data format remains JSON and our backend is ready for it. We might create an API key system or OAuth for the mobile app if it’s public, but fundamentally no major changes to backend are needed – this is the beauty of the headless approach.

**Partner Portal & B2B Expansion:** The wholesale functionality might expand to a full-fledged partner portal with more self-service features (downloading invoice PDFs, seeing order history analytics, placing repeat orders by uploading a CSV, etc.). Our role-based system and data separation (Partners vs Customers) already lays the groundwork. We can iterate on the portal pages without affecting retail pages. For instance, adding a “Partner Dashboard” page that shows monthly order volume or new product announcements exclusively to partners. The backend can handle more complex pricing rules if needed (like contract-specific pricing: we could add a table for PartnerProductPrice to override prices for certain partners, etc., which ties into our existing queries without massive changes).

**AI Expansion (CRM & Logistics):** We implemented two agents, but there is potential for more AI-driven functionality:

* **CRM Follow-ups:** An AI could analyze customer purchase patterns (both retail and wholesale) and generate personalized follow-up messages. For example, after a purchase, an AI could draft an email like “Thank you for buying our handcrafted item, here’s how to care for it...” or, after a period, “We thought you might like the new edition of the item you bought last year.” This could be integrated with an email service to send automatically or for admin approval. Our system stores order history, so an AI agent can be given read-access to that and templated messages to construct these communications.
* **Logistics Notifications:** Another future agent could handle tracking updates. If we integrate courier APIs that provide tracking status, an AI could proactively notify customers in a conversational manner: e.g., on the website or via chatbot, “Your package is out for delivery today. Make sure someone is home to receive it! 🙂”. Or internally, if a shipment is delayed, an AI alerts the admin “Order #101 delivery is delayed due to weather, consider notifying the customer.” These kinds of intelligent insights can be layered in because our architecture can accommodate additional services subscribing to order events.
* **Workshop Assistant AI:** Even internally, the family could use an AI agent that has all product recipes/instructions. If a new family member is learning the craft, they could ask the AI “How do we finish the surface of the oak toy cars?” if all that knowledge is digitized. This is speculative, but shows that adding new AI modules (maybe integrated into the admin panel as a help tool) is feasible through Flowise as we have it set up.

**Microservices or Modular Scale-Out:** If one aspect of the business explodes (say they start a subscription box service for monthly crafts, or a custom engraving service), we might spin that into a separate microservice for isolation. Our current monolithic backend can be gradually modulized – e.g., a separate service for inventory or for payments – because the front communicates via APIs anyway. We would register new API endpoints or services and adjust Nginx routes accordingly (like `/api/payments/` goes to a payments service). We mention this not to complicate the present, but to assure that our architecture does not paint us into a corner. It’s flexible enough to move towards microservices or serverless functions for certain tasks if beneficial.

**Upgrading & Maintenance:** The choices of tech (React/Next, Express, Postgres) are mainstream and have a large ecosystem, meaning new libraries and updates will continue to support them. We plan regular maintenance: updating dependencies, security patches, etc. If at some point a technology swap is needed (for instance, moving from Express REST to GraphQL to allow more complex client queries), our separation of concerns means we could introduce GraphQL alongside REST without breaking the system. Similarly, if Postgres needs to be sharded or if a NoSQL store is introduced for something (like caching product search in ElasticSearch), it can be added as an adjunct component rather than a core replacement.

**Conclusion:** This extensibility plan ensures that Krecik Manufaktura’s platform is not a static endpoint, but a living system that can grow features and scale as the business transitions from a small family workshop to, perhaps, a major artisanal brand. Every layer – UI, backend, infrastructure – has been designed with **the next steps in mind**, so new capabilities can be integrated in a **controlled and cost-effective manner**, aligning with the evolving operational reality of the business. The family can thus continue to focus on their craft and story, with the confidence that the technology will support their ambitions at every stage.
